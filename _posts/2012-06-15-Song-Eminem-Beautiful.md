你的一部分，永远是你的一部分
你很美，因为你的本质就很美

 
 
Eminem: Beautiful 


Lately I've been hard to reach 最近我变得让人难以接近  
I've been too long on my own  或许是因为我已经一个人呆太久了  
Everybody has a private world 每个人都有仅属于自己的一片天空  
Where they can be alone       在那儿他可以安静的呆一会，静一静  
Are you calling me            你还在打电话找我吗？  
are you trying to get through 是想和我说说话吗？  
Are you reaching out for me   你想了解我吗？  
and I'm reaching out for you  其实我也想了解了解你  
 
I'm just so fu-ckin' depressed        我只是感到很压抑  
I just can seem to get out this slump 似乎就是无法爬出低谷  
If I could just get over this hump    除非我能爬过这座高山  
But I need something to pull me out this dump 但是真希望有什么可以将我拉出这深渊  
I took my bruises, took my lumps        尽管身上带着淤青和肿块  
Fell down and I got right back up       即使再摔倒了也会立刻爬起来  
But I need that spark to get psyched back up 但我渴望那种能将我救赎的激情   
And the right thing for me to pick that mic back up 这样我才能继续做麦克风前的霸王  
I don't know how I pry away           到底需要怎样做  
And I ended up in this position I'm in 告别这种状态 !? 
I starting to feel distant again      又是那种该死的被抛弃被孤立的感觉！  
So I decided just to beat this pain   所以我便拿起笔来开火  
Up and tried to make an attempt to vent 想要发泄，想要赶走他们 
But I just can't admit               但我真的不得不承认一个事实 
Or come to grips, with the fact that 那就是 
I may be done with rap               我愿意和饶舌一起去死  
I need a new outlet                  请在给我一个出口吧 
I know some shits so hard to swallow 我怎可能忍气吞声！  
But I just can't sit back and wallow  我不可能安稳的坐着，或者原地打转，   
In my own sorrow                      永远走不出糟糕的忧郁  
But I know one fact                   但我知道  
I'll be one tough act to follow       若我起身，跟随我的脚步可不是一件轻松的事  
One tough act to follow              很难的  
Copy                                 模仿我  
One tough act to follow              你会累死  
Here today, gone tomorrow            昨日已逝，明日未知，今日启程  
But you have to walk a thousand miles 等待你的是漫漫长路     
 
Walk my shoes, just to see  进入我的灵魂，认真感受 
What it's like, to be me    成为我是什么样的感觉  
I'll be you, let's trade shoes  交换灵魂，我成为你  
Just to see what I'd be like to 看看我们能不能了解彼此 
Feel your pain, you feel mine  我感受到你的痛苦，你发现了我的伤悲  
Go inside each other's mind    深入彼此的灵魂中  
Just to see what we find       试试看会有什么新发现  
look at shit through each others eyes 透过对方的眼再看看这个世界 
But don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo  别让任何人说你不够美  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo 让他们都去死吧，你只需做好你自己  
Don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo     别让任何人说你不够美  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you 让他们都去死 ，展现本色 问心无愧！ 
 
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor  幽默感渐逝 
Everything is so tense and gloom                我的弦紧紧的绷着 
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room 一踏进房间空气凝固  
Just as soon as I walk in    
It's like all eyes on me                       感觉所有人都在盯着我  
So I try to avoid any eye contact              所以我谁也不看 
Cause if I do that then it opens a door to conversation 如果这么做的话就打开了话匣子  
Like I want that...                            就好像是我故意的  
I'm not looking for extra attention            我并不想吸引多余目光  
I just want to be just like you                我只想像你一样  
Blend in with the rest of the room             跟其他人打成一片  
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom    或者告诉我最近的休息室在哪 
I don't need fucking man servin'               我不需要谁他妈的来讨好我  
Tryin to follow me around, and wipe my ass     做我的跟屁虫拍我马屁  
Laugh at every single joke I crack             给我讲的每个笑话捧场  
And half of them ain't even funny like that    事实上它们之中有一半根本没那么好笑  
"Ahh Marshall, you're so funny man,"          “哈哈哈哈马修 哥们你太逗了”
"you should be a comedian, god damn.           你他妈可以去当个喜剧演员了。"  
Unfortunately I am                             很不幸我就是一个可笑的演员  
but I just hide behind the tears of a clown      是一个咽下所有眼泪的小丑
So why don't you all sit down                  所以 静下来坐坐好吗
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell           安静的听我讲故事吧  
Hell, we don't have to trade our shoes          算了，我们根本用不着交换灵魂
And you don't have to walk one thousand miles    因为你永远不会知道我的苦涩  
Walk my shoes, just to see  
What it's like, to be me  
All be you, let's trade shoes  
Just to see what I'd be like to  
Feel your pain, you feel mine  
Go inside each other's mind  
Just to see what we find  
Looking shit through each other's eyes  
But don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo  
Don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo  
 
Nobody asked for life to deal us     没有人想要生活这样对待我们
With these bullshit hands with doubt 充满混乱怀疑与虚假   
We have to take these cards ourselves 但我们必须振作起来 
And flip them, don't expect no help   把恶心的东西弹走，自立自强 
Now I could have either just          现在我也可以选择  
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned   喝的大醉，抱怨不停 
But take this situation in which I'm placed in 但在这种处境中 
And get up and get my own             我必须靠自己振作起来  
I was never the type of kid           我从来不是那种只会等别人帮忙的孩子  
To wait but I know to unpack his bags 我会自己收拾烂摊子
Never sat on the porch and hoped and prayed 我才不会坐在走廊里  
For a dad to show up who never did         祈祷那个从没来过的的老爸快出现  
I just wanted to fit in  我只是希望能融入
Every single place       我去的每个地方
Every school I went      每一所学校
I dreamed of being that cool kid 我曾经梦想做个酷小孩
Even if it meant acting stupid  即使那意味着看起来很傻  
Aunt Edna always told me        艾德娜阿姨一直告诉我  
Keep making that face till it gets stuck like that 你可以板着脸直到僵住  
Meanwhile I'm just standing there               然后我就在那里  
Holding my tongue up trying to talk like this   用僵硬的表情试着 “这样” 说话  
Till I stuck my tungue on the frozen stop sign poll at 8 years old 直到我的舌头冻结了 极端不想言语，那年我 8 岁  
I learned my lesson and cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more 我吸取了教训 我不再想引起朋友的注意
But I already told you my whole life story 我已经向你们吐露心声  
Not just based on my description           不止是建立在言语上 
Cause where you see it from where you're sitting 但若你只肯站在你的角度看  
Is probably 110% different                      会 110% 不一样  
guess we would have to walk a mile             我想我们应该交换灵魂（交换鞋子）试试  
In each other's shoes, at least                至少走上一英里吧  
What size you where?                           你鞋码多大？  
I wear tens                                    我穿 10 号  
Let's see if you can fit your feet             看看你的脚穿我的鞋能不能正好  
Walk my shoes, just to see  
What it's like, to be me  
All be you, let's trade shoes  
Just to see what I'd be like to  
Feel your pain, you feel mine  
Go inside each other's mind  
Just to see what we find  
Looking shit through each other's eyes  
But don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo  
Don't let'em say you ain't beautiful OoOo  
They can all get fu-cked. Just stay true to you sOoOoo

I've been too long on my own  
Everyone has a private world   Where they can be alone... sOoOoo  
Are you calling me,

 Daddy will be home soon            爸爸就快到家了  
And to the rest of the world        献给世上其他的人  
God gave you the shoes              上帝给了你 专属你的鞋子

be proud of who you are                   为你的本色而自豪
